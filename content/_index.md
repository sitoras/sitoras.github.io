Hi! Iâ€™m Sitora, a PhD student in [Brain, Mind, and Computer Science](http://hit.psy.unipd.it/BMCS) at the University of Padova, working under the supervision of [Prof. Mauro Conti](https://www.math.unipd.it/~conti/) as part of his [Security and Privacy (SPRITZ) research group](https://spritz.math.unipd.it). 
My research focuses on Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and Operational Technology (OT) security. Specifically, I explore the security of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), with an emphasis on protecting critical infrastructures. My work includes software security, vulnerability detection, and reverse engineering, with a growing interest in applying machine learning and deep learning techniques to solve complex cybersecurity problems.
