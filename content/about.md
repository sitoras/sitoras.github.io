My name is Sitora, and I hold a Master’s degree in Cybersecurity from the University of Padua, completed in 2023.
I am currently pursuing a PhD as part of Prof. Mauro Conti’s research group, focusing on the security of Industrial Control Systems (ICS) and Operational Technology (OT). My PhD research addresses the unique cybersecurity challenges faced by Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) and is conducted in collaboration with [Unindustria Servizi & Formazione Treviso Pordenone S.C.A.R.L](https://unisef.it) on ICS/OT security for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs).
